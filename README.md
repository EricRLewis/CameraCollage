# CameraCollage
This small Android camera application allows users to combine several photos into a collage.

How to use:
To capture a picture, touch the picture on screen. This will capture and bring up a new camera window next to the photo.
Capture multiple pictures to start building a collage. If the number of pictures is less than 5 then the pictures can be 
dragged around.

If there are too many images to fit on the screen, the collage becomes a scroll panel. 
This allows users to create any size image they please.

The screen is locked in landscape so the user may turn their phone to take pictures at any angle.
